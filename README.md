## Documentation

### Quick Introduction for busy developers

There are 6 primary classes in the package:

``` python
from ucsc.api import Hub, Genome, Track, TrackSchema, Chromosome, Sequence  
```



Each class has the following primary method:

``` python
# check documentation for required and optional parameters

className.get()  # Returns list of objects of the class

className.find()  # Find object by name

className.findBy()  # Find object by a specified attribute

className.exists()  # Check to see if an object exists
```

Then you can access the attributes of the object using . notation
``` python
className.attributeName # Returns attribute name
```


## Use case

Suppose you want to work on and analyze Covid-19 dataset
what precise steps you will take to accomplish the task?

well, you might have an order like this:

1- Retrieve all genomic data related to Covid-19, such as
track data, sequence data â€¦etc

2- Build your algorithm to apply some computations on the data you just retrieved

The package focuses on helping you retrieve the data faster, and
keep your focus on the algorithm itself, you don't want to make a dozen of
get requests and go back and forth to the api, 
you will find yourself focusing on the details of getting the data rather than working on it!

To demonstrate my purpose here, let's see how fast you can get started!

Step one: From the UCSC Datasets, you found out that the assembly name of Covid-19 is wuhCor1

Step two: You now want to get its data, let's do it! :

```python
from ucsc.api import Genome  

# get the wuhCor1 from the UCSC database and return a python object
genome = Genome.find('wuhCor1')

# wanna access the attributes?
print(genome.name)
print(genome.organism)
print(genome.__dict__) # to return all attributes in the object


# want to get the tracks?
tracks = genome.tracks

# you can also loop over the tracks, which is basically a list of objects
# you can also find specific track using the given methods!

track = genome.findTrack('nameOfTheTrack') 

# don't know the name? 
# don't be nervous, you can access it using any attribute
track = genome.findTrackBy('url','trackUrl')

# you now have a track object, you want to get all it's related data?
# i mean you wanna state it's chromosomes, other info (useful if uou wanna build your own genome browser)

sequence = track.getTrackData(genome='wuhCor1')

# Get track data for specified track and chromosome in wuhCor1
# You can also specify other flags, check usage for more details.

track.getTrackData(genome='wuhCor1', chrom='chr1')

# Wanna download them for offline processing?

track.downloadData(genome='wuhCor1', chrom='chr1', hubUrl=hubUrl, start=4321, end=5678)



```




    

## Usage guide

List of available hubs as python objects 


```python
from ucsc.api import Hub  

hubList = Hub.get()
```


Find hub by name, the function will return the result as an object or throws a not found exception


```python 
from ucsc.api import Hub  

hub = Hub.find('ALFA Hub') 
```

Find hub by given attribute, the function will return the result as an object or throws a not found exception


```python
from ucsc.api import Hub  

hub = Hub.findBy('hubName','ALFA Hub') 
```


Get all genomes from specified hub object
  

```python
from ucsc.api import Hub  

hub = Hub.find('ALFA Hub')

print(hub.genomes) # prints the list of all genomes in the given hub

``` 


Get all genomes from all UCSC Database


```python
from ucsc.api import Genome 

genomesList = Genome.get() 
```



Find genome by name, the function will return the result as an object or throws a not found exception

```python
from ucsc.api import Genome 

genome = Genome.find('ALFA Genome') 
```  

Find genome by given attribute, the function will return the result as an object or throws a not found exception



```python
from ucsc.api import Genome  

genome = Genome.findBy('genomeName','ALFA Genome') 
```

Check if genome exists in a UCSC database

```python
from ucsc.api import Genome

Genome.exists('hg38') 
```

List the available tracks of the genome object


```python
from ucsc.api import Genome 

genome = Genome.find('ALFA Genome') 
tracks = genome.tracks 
```

 
Find a specific track in a genome by name, the return type is an object of track

```python
from ucsc.api import Track 

track = Track.find('hg38','knownGene') 

```
Or using a Genome object



```python 
from ucsc.api import Genome 

genome.findTrack('knownGene')
```

Find a specific track using a specific attribute, the return type is an object of track


```python
from ucsc.api import Track

track = Track.findBy('hg38','longLabel','ClinGen curation ') 
```

Or using a Genome object


```python 
from ucsc.api import Genome 

genome.findTrackBy('longLabel','knownGene')
```

Check if track exists in a genome


```python
from ucsc.api import Track 

Track.exists('hg38','knownGene') 
```

```python 
from ucsc.api import Genome 

genome.isTrackExists('longLabel')
```

List the schema of specified track from given genome 



```python
from ucsc.api import Track 

track = Track.find('hg38','knownGene') 

trackSchema = track.schema('hg38')
```

Get track data depends on the parameter you will pass to the trackData function, listed below the possible parameter for each use case

```python
from ucsc.api import Track

track = Track.find('hg38', 'knownGene')  # or you can get the track using the findBy method

# Get track data for specified track in UCSC database genome
